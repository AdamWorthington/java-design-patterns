# Factory Design Pattern

## Overview

The factory design pattern is a creational design pattern. It is used when you want to expose the ability to create objects, without exposing the actual logic and accompanying complexity itself. Generally done with the use of interfaces and/or overloaded constructors.

## Use Cases

* Deterministic and regular object processing during creation.
* Allows the object to defer creation of subclasses until a later point.
* To veil object creation logic.
