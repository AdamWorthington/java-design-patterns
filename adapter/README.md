# Adapter Design Pattern

## Overview

The adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern. It is used when you need to allow two previously incompatible objects to interact with eachother. Also allows for greater resuse of code through layering abstraction.

## Use Cases

* When an object needs to utilize an existing class with an incompatible interface.
* To create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which don't have compatible interfaces.
* To abstract out complexity for code reuse.
