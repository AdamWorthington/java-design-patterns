# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern. It is used when you want exclusivly one instance of an object to be instantiated at a time. Generally done with the use of private constructors and global accessor methods (getInstance()).

## Use Cases

* Control concurrent access to a shared resource.
* Access a resource from multiple, disparate parts of a system.
* Restrict object creation to one instance.
